        <p>
            I am a twenty-seven year old professional application developer of four years, the past three spent working in the aeronautical industry creating software for UAVs(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles).  This opportunity has given me great experience working
            with very talented people and I have traveled to many places in the US for software support.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a hobby I try to write games and learn how to create assets for them.  I love music of all kinds and produce my own songs from time to time, as well as
            explore the art of electronic synthesis.  I hope to eventually create all of the artistic assets for one of my games. I also wrote this site from scratch (it's responsive!) and maintain it.

            In a previous life I spent time experimenting with electronic synthesis and production.  Some of my music is featured in various online rhythm games, such as Flash Flash Revolution and Thirdstyle.

            Every now and then I crank out a jingle, but I mainly aim to fill my games with my own music and sound effects.
